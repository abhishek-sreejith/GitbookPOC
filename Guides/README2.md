# Usage

### Deployment

Install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

and then deploy with:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-project-dev (196s)

endpoint: ANY - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
functions:
  api: aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-project-dev-api (766 kB)
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [`httpApi` event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api/). Additionally, in current configuration, the DynamoDB table will be removed when running `serverless remove`. To retain the DynamoDB table even after removal of the stack, add `DeletionPolicy: Retain` to its resource definition.

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can create a new user by calling the corresponding endpoint:

```bash
curl --request POST 'https://xxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/users' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"name": "John", "userId": "someUserId"}'
```
